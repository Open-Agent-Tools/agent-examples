# Deep Research Dave Agent

## ⚠️ UNDER CONSTRUCTION - NON-WORKING ⚠️
**This agent is currently being redesigned and rebuilt. It is not functional in its current state.**
**See [gap_analysis.md](./gap_analysis.md) for detailed implementation plan.**

A specialized AI research agent built on the AWS Strands framework for conducting comprehensive, systematic research across any domain. This agent implements the patterns described in the [Deep Research Agent PRD](../../PRD_Examples/Deep%20Research%20Agent/).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive chat interface (recommended)
cd AWS_Strands/DeepResearch_Dave
uv run python agent.py

# Programmatic usage
from AWS_Strands.DeepResearch_Dave import DeepResearchDave
dave = DeepResearchDave()
result = await dave.deep_research("Your research topic")
```

## Current Implementation Status ❌

Deep Research Dave is **under construction** and requires significant refactoring:

- ⚠️ **Basic research workflow** exists but needs enhancement
- ❌ **No persistent storage** - research lost between sessions
- ❌ **Limited quality assurance** - basic credibility only
- ❌ **Missing academic sources** - no ArXiv, Scholar, PubMed
- ❌ **No configuration management** - fixed parameters only
- ❌ **Lacks security controls** - no encryption or audit trails

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```env
# Required for AI model access
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here

# Required for live web search (get from tavily.com)
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key_here
```

### Planned Features (Not Yet Implemented)
- **Comprehensive Research**: Multi-phase structured approach (plan → gather → analyze → report)
- **Source Validation**: Automatic credibility assessment and fact-checking
- **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side evaluation of options
- **Professional Output**: Academic-quality reports with proper citations

## Current Development Status

Reference: [Gap analysis and implementation plan](./gap_analysis.md) | [Original TODO.md](./TODO.md)

### Priority 1: Persistent Research Infrastructure
**Need**: Research projects that span multiple sessions and persistent artifact storage

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **Research Workspace System** - Create `.research_workspace/` directory structure
- [ ] **Artifact Management** - Save/load research notes, sources, analysis, and draft reports
- [ ] **Project Lifecycle** - Create, resume, and archive research projects across sessions
- [ ] **Session Continuity** - Resume interrupted research with full context

**Success Criteria**: Will maintain research projects across multiple chat sessions with persistent storage

### Priority 2: Specialized Research Sub-Agents  
**Need**: Domain-specific expertise for complex research tasks

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **Literature Review Agent** - Academic paper analysis and synthesis
- [ ] **Source Validation Agent** - Advanced credibility assessment and fact-checking  
- [ ] **Data Analysis Agent** - Quantitative analysis and pattern recognition
- [ ] **Synthesis Agent** - Cross-source insight generation and contradiction resolution
- [ ] **Agent Coordination** - Delegate tasks and integrate sub-agent results

**Success Criteria**: Will enable specialized agents to handle domain-specific research with integrated results

### Priority 3: Advanced Research Quality & Methodologies
**Need**: PhD-level research rigor and systematic approaches

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **Systematic Review Tools** - Formal methodology templates and workflows
- [ ] **Meta-Analysis Capabilities** - Statistical analysis across multiple studies  
- [ ] **Bias Detection** - Identify and mitigate research bias systematically
- [ ] **Confidence Scoring** - Quantitative reliability assessment for all findings
- [ ] **Academic Integration** - Connect to scholarly databases and citation tools

**Success Criteria**: Will produce research output meeting academic publication standards

### Priority 4: Professional Reporting & Knowledge Management
**Need**: Publication-ready outputs and organizational memory

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **Advanced Report Formatting** - PDF, LaTeX, academic citation styles
- [ ] **Knowledge Base Integration** - Learn from previous research to improve future work
- [ ] **Research Dashboard** - Visual progress tracking and project management
- [ ] **Export Integration** - Zotero, Mendeley, and academic tool compatibility
- [ ] **Collaboration Features** - Team research and knowledge sharing

**Success Criteria**: Will generate professional publication-ready reports with organizational learning

## Architecture Overview

Deep Research Dave follows a modular design that implements the [Deep Research Agent PRD](../../PRD_Examples/Deep%20Research%20Agent/):

- **Research Orchestrator**: `DeepResearchDave` class managing workflow
- **Information Discovery**: Tavily MCP integration for web search
- **Content Evaluation**: Built-in source credibility assessment
- **Research State Management**: `ResearchSession` class for context tracking
- **Synthesis Engine**: Multi-phase analysis and report generation

## Current Limitations

- **Non-functional**: Agent requires complete rebuild based on gap analysis
- Research artifacts don't persist across sessions
- No specialized sub-agents for domain expertise
- Limited to single-session research projects  
- Basic source validation without advanced fact-checking
- No integration with academic databases or citation tools
- Missing core PRD requirements for quality assurance and persistence

## Usage Examples

### Interactive Chat Commands
- `help` - Show available commands
- `session: <topic>` - Start comprehensive research session
- `compare <option1> vs <option2>` - Comparative analysis
- `status` - Show current research progress

### Programmatic Usage
```python
# Comprehensive research
await dave.start_research_session("AI safety research", "comprehensive")
findings = await dave.conduct_research_phase("Focus on alignment approaches")
analysis = await dave.synthesize_findings(["technical", "ethical", "practical"])
report = await dave.generate_research_report("comprehensive")

# Comparative analysis  
result = await dave.compare_options(
    options=["Constitutional AI", "RLHF", "Debate"],
    criteria=["scalability", "safety", "interpretability"]
)
```

## Contributing

To extend Deep Research Dave's capabilities:

1. **Add Research Tools** - Implement new `@tool` functions in `research_tools.py`
2. **Create Sub-Agents** - Follow patterns in `sub_agents/` directory
3. **Enhance Methodologies** - Add templates to `templates/` directory
4. **Improve Quality** - Extend credibility assessment algorithms

## Next Steps

See the [gap analysis document](./gap_analysis.md) for comprehensive implementation roadmap. The immediate focus is on persistent workspace infrastructure to enable multi-session research projects, followed by advanced quality assurance systems.
