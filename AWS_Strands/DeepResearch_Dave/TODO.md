# DeepResearch_Dave Enhancement Plan

*Updated based on recent refactoring and architecture improvements*

## Executive Summary

DeepResearch_Dave has been successfully refactored (August 2025) to focus exclusively on deep, multi-phase research. The agent now automatically initiates comprehensive research sessions for every query, removing quick research capabilities (now handled by QuickResearch_Quinten). The next phase focuses on advanced research infrastructure, persistent workspaces, and specialized sub-agents.

## Recent Refactoring Achievements âœ…

### Core Architecture Improvements (Completed August 2025)
- âœ… **Removed Quick Research** - All queries now trigger multi-phase deep research
- âœ… **Multi-Step Research Sessions** - `deep_research()` method with structured phases:
  1. Start comprehensive research session
  2. Information gathering phase
  3. Analysis and synthesis phase  
  4. Comprehensive report generation
- âœ… **Deep Comparative Analysis** - `comparative_deep_research()` with multi-phase evaluation
- âœ… **Updated System Prompts** - Focus exclusively on comprehensive, scholarly research
- âœ… **Enhanced Chat Interface** - All commands route to deep research methods
- âœ… **Agent Separation** - QuickResearch_Quinten handles rapid lookups, Dave handles depth

### Current Strengths
- Tavily MCP integration for real-time web search
- Multi-phase research methodology with automatic session management
- Deep comparative analysis capabilities
- Research-specific prompts and scholarly approach
- Clean utilities integration and chat interface

## Current State Assessment

### âœ… **Working Well**
- Comprehensive research sessions with multiple phases
- Structured research workflow (plan â†’ gather â†’ analyze â†’ report)
- Source evaluation and credibility assessment
- Session tracking and context management
- Multi-model support with fallback options

### ðŸš§ **Critical Gaps Remaining**
- No persistent workspace for research artifacts across sessions
- Limited sub-agent capabilities for specialized research tasks
- No advanced research planning and project management
- Cannot handle long-term research projects spanning multiple sessions
- Limited research quality assurance and validation tools
