## 8. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Start Phase 1** - Workspace implementation is critical foundation
2. **Create branch** - `feature/persistent-workspace`
3. **Design review** - Validate workspace architecture before coding
4. **Update tests** - Extend test coverage for new features

### Strategic Decisions
1. **Prioritize persistence** over advanced features initially
2. **Build modular** - Each component should be independent
3. **Maintain compatibility** - Don't break existing functionality
4. **Document thoroughly** - Each new feature needs clear docs

### Long-term Vision
1. **Phase approach** - Complete each phase before moving forward
2. **User feedback** - Gather feedback after each phase
3. **Performance monitoring** - Track metrics continuously
4. **Iterative improvement** - Refine based on real usage

## Conclusion

The current DeepResearch_Dave implementation successfully implements the core research workflow from the PRD but lacks critical infrastructure for persistence, advanced quality assurance, and expanded information sources. The proposed phased implementation plan addresses these gaps systematically, with Phase 1 (persistent workspace) being the most critical foundation for all subsequent enhancements.

The implementation should proceed in strict phases, with each phase building upon the previous one. Success metrics should be continuously monitored, and the plan should be adjusted based on real-world usage and feedback.
