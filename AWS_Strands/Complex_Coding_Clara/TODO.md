# Complex Coding Clara - Implementation TODO

Implementation roadmap for a multi-agent coding system based on the architecture defined in `coding-agent-architecture.md`.

## Architecture Overview

Clara is a **meta-orchestrator** that coordinates 7 specialized coding agents using intelligent routing, multi-agent patterns (Graph/Swarm), and cost optimization.

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Patterns

#### 2.1 Graph Pattern (Deterministic Workflows)

  - [ ] Sequential workflow: Router → Agent → Test → Review → Documentation
  - [ ] Use Strands `GraphBuilder`
  - [ ] Add conditional branching (e.g., if review fails, return to coder)
  - [ ] Support for parallel execution where appropriate

**Example Graph Flow:**
```
User Request → Router → [Architect/Senior/Fast Coder] → Test Engineer → Code Reviewer → Documentation → Output
                                                                              ↓ (if issues)
                                                                         Back to Coder
```

#### 2.2 Swarm Pattern (Exploratory Collaboration)
- [ ] Implement `patterns/swarm_pattern.py`:
  - [ ] Use Strands `Swarm` class
  - [ ] Allow multiple agents to collaborate simultaneously
  - [ ] Meta-orchestrator synthesizes results
  - [ ] Good for research, exploration, multiple approaches

**Example Swarm Flow:**
```
User Request → Meta Orchestrator → [Senior Coder + Fast Coder + Test Engineer + Reviewer]
                                   (All collaborate in parallel)
                                            ↓
                                   Synthesized Solution
```

  - [ ] Select pattern (Graph vs Swarm)
  - [ ] Coordinate specialist agents
  - [ ] Synthesize final output
- [ ] Use Claude Sonnet 4.5
- [ ] Integration with router
- [ ] Integration with both patterns
- [ ] State management across multi-turn conversations

### Phase 3: Tools Integration (Use Existing)

- [ ] Use `shell(command="git diff <file>")` for diffs
- [ ] Use `shell(command="git log")` for history
- [ ] Document need for git write operations in Phase 4

#### 3.2 Custom Tools (Deferred to Phase 4)
**Code Analysis (NOT in MVP):**
- [ ] `parse_ast(code: str, language: str) -> dict` - Phase 4
- [ ] `analyze_complexity(code: str) -> dict` - Phase 4
- [ ] `find_references(symbol: str, workspace: str) -> list` - Phase 4

## Cost Targets (from architecture doc)

- **Simple Task**: ~$0.04 (endpoint, typo fix)
- **Medium Task**: ~$0.20 (feature implementation)
- **Complex Task**: ~$0.57 (algorithm, architecture)
- **Daily Development**: ~$2.54/day (mixed tasks)
- **Monthly**: ~$50-75/developer

---

## Technical Decisions Needed

1. **Model Access**: Confirm availability of Nova models on Bedrock vs using Claude alternatives
2. **Llama 3.3**: Determine if available through Bedrock or if we need alternative
3. **LSP Integration**: Decide on LSP library/approach for code intelligence
4. **Sandboxing**: Choose sandboxing approach for code execution (Docker, pyodide, other)
5. **Storage**: Local filesystem vs S3 for session persistence in MVP
6. **Testing Framework**: pytest + custom eval framework vs ADK eval approach
