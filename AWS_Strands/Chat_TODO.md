## Implementation Notes

### Dependencies to Consider
- `readline` - command history (built-in)
- `rich` - better terminal formatting
- `pyperclip` - clipboard support
- `textual` - TUI framework (if going that route)
- `click` - better CLI (already in requirements)

### Backward Compatibility
- Keep simple mode for users who don't want features
- All enhancements should be optional
- Graceful degradation when features unavailable

### Testing
- Test on macOS, Linux, Windows
- Test with different terminal emulators
- Test with different agent types
- Performance testing with long conversations

## Quick Wins (Start Here)
1. ✅ **DONE** - Add readline for command history (easy, huge impact)
2. ✅ **DONE** - Implement clear command (trivial, useful)
3. ⏭️ Add save conversation (medium effort, valuable)
4. ✅ **DONE** - Token tracking display (shows costs)
5. ✅ **DONE** - Multi-line input (essential for code)
6. ✅ **DONE** - Error recovery with retry logic

## Recently Completed

### Status Bar (Minimal) ✅ (2025-01-08)
- Clean top-positioned status bar with box drawing characters
- Shows 4 key metrics:
  - Agent name
  - Model ID (shortened if too long)
  - Query count (tracks queries per session)
  - Session time (minutes and seconds)
- Configuration-controlled (ui.show_status_bar in .chatrc)
- Default: disabled (opt-in)
- Updates after each query
- Auto-clears screen and redraws for clean display
- No dependencies beyond Python stdlib
- Graceful fallback if disabled

**Design Decisions:**
- Minimal fields (not token/cost - those need tracking first)
- Top position (always visible)
- All-or-nothing config (no field picker)
- Config-only control (no CLI flag)
- Clean box drawing style with │ separators

**Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Clara │ Sonnet 4.5 │ 3 queries │ 12m 34s        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Token/Cost Tracking ✅ (2025-01-08)
- Track input and output tokens per query
- Display session totals with formatted numbers (K/M suffix)
- Cost estimation for Claude and GPT models
- Per-query breakdown showing input/output tokens
- Session cost running total
- Integration with status bar (shows token count when enabled)
- Configuration-controlled (features.show_tokens in .chatrc)
- Default: disabled (opt-in)
- Multiple response pattern support (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
- Graceful handling of unknown models (shows tokens but no cost)

**Implementation:**
- TokenTracker class with pricing table for common models
- Pricing: per-million-token rates for input and output separately
- Token extraction from response objects (multiple attribute patterns)
- Per-query display: `Tokens: 1.2K (in: 234, out: 1.0K) │ Cost: $0.0123 │ Session: $0.0456`
- Status bar integration: shows running total when both status bar and token tracking enabled

**Design Decisions:**
- Separate input/output pricing (more accurate than blended)
- K/M formatting for readability (1234 → 1.2K, 1234567 → 1.2M)
- Cost only shown if > $0 (unknown models don't show "$0.00")
- Session total tracks across queries (resets on clear)

**Example Output:**
```
------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2.3s │ Tokens: 1.5K (in: 234, out: 1.3K) │ Cost: $0.0213 │ Session: $0.0789
```

### Configuration File Support ✅ (2025-01-08)

- Configurable sections:
  - **Colors**: All ANSI color codes (user, agent, system, error, success, dim)
  - **Features**: auto_save, rich_enabled, show_tokens, show_metadata, readline_enabled
  - **Paths**: save_location, log_location
  - **Behavior**: max_retries, retry_delay, timeout, spinner_style
  - **UI**: show_banner, show_thinking_indicator, show_duration
- Per-agent overrides: Customize settings for specific agents by name
- Example config file with detailed comments and alternative color schemes
- Optional --config CLI argument for explicit config path
- Graceful fallback when YAML not available or config missing
- Dot-notation access (e.g., 'features.auto_save')
- Deep merge for nested configurations

**Files Created:**
- `AWS_Strands/chat_config.py` - Configuration loader and manager (280 lines)

**Integration Points:**
- Colors applied from config on startup
- All behavior settings configurable
- Banner shows config status and auto-save location
- Info command shows config-enabled features

### Streaming Progress Indicator ✅ (2025-01-08)
- Animated thinking indicator while waiting for first token
- Rich spinner with "dots" animation for terminals with rich library
- Fallback to simple animated dots (...) for basic terminals
- Automatically hides when first token arrives
- Proper cleanup on errors and completion
- Non-blocking async implementation

### Agent Metadata Display ✅ (2025-01-08)

### Clear Command with Session Reset ✅ (2025-01-08)
- Type `clear` to clear terminal and reset agent session
- Cross-platform support (Unix `clear` and Windows `cls`)
- Gracefully cleans up old agent if cleanup method exists
- Creates fresh agent instance using agent factory
- Re-displays banner after clear
- Maintains command history across session resets

## Completed Earlier (2025-01-08)

### Command History with Full Readline Support ✅
- ↑↓ arrow keys navigate through command history
- Full line editing with ←→ arrow keys, backspace, delete
- Standard emacs keybindings (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E, Ctrl+K, etc.)
- Ctrl+R for reverse history search
- Persistent history saved to `~/.chat_history` (1000 commands)
- Fixed: Direct input() calls instead of executor to preserve readline functionality

### Multi-line Input Support ✅
- Type `\\` to enter multi-line mode
- Continue entering lines with `...` prompt
- Press Enter on empty line to submit
- Full readline editing works in multi-line mode too
- Perfect for pasting code blocks or long prompts

### Automatic Error Recovery ✅
- **Timeout handling**: 3 retry attempts with 2s delay between tries
- **Connection errors**: Automatic retry with clear status messages
- **Rate limiting**: Smart detection with exponential backoff (2s → 4s → 8s)
- Color-coded error messages (red) with helpful suggestions
- All errors logged for debugging
- Non-retryable errors fail fast with actionable messages

## Implementation Notes & Lessons Learned

### Command History
- **Key Learning:** Using `asyncio.run_in_executor()` breaks readline's terminal access
- **Solution:** Use direct `input()` calls - blocking on user input is fine
- **Benefit:** Full readline functionality preserved (editing, search, keybindings)

### Multi-line Input
- **Design Choice:** `\\` trigger is clear and doesn't conflict with normal input
- **Alternative Considered:** Press Enter twice (rejected - too easy to accidentally submit)
- **Works Well With:** Readline editing works in multi-line mode seamlessly

### Error Recovery
- **Retry Strategy:** 3 attempts for transient errors, fail fast for others
- **Rate Limits:** Exponential backoff prevents hammering the API
- **User Experience:** Show attempt count and clear error messages

## Known Issues

None currently - all implemented features working as expected.
