# File Operations Sub-Agent - Implementation Status

## âœ… Completed
- [x] Agent configuration with specialized file operation tools
- [x] Focused prompt for file operations only
- [x] Integration with main Jitin agent as sub-agent
- [x] Separation of concerns: write operations delegated, read operations retained
- [x] Module structure and exports

## ðŸ”§ Tools Implemented
**Write Operations:**
- write_file_from_string
- append_to_file
- delete_file
- move_file
- copy_file

**Directory Operations:**
- create_directory
- delete_directory

**Validation Tools:**
- file_exists
- directory_exists

## ðŸ“‹ Architecture
- Main agent (Jitin) retains all read operations and code logic
- Sub-agent (FileOps) handles all write operations
- Clean delegation pattern established
- Focused, single-responsibility design

## ðŸ§ª Testing Required
- [ ] Test file creation and modification workflows
- [ ] Test directory operations
- [ ] Test delegation from main agent to sub-agent
- [ ] Test complex workflows requiring both agents
- [ ] Verify error handling and reporting
